# localserve
a script for working with serve and json-server

## Installation
Clone this repo and run `./install-localserve my_project_dir`.

Also, it's a good idea to add the following to your `.gitignore` so you don't track transient things like logfiles and live database files:

```
api/db.json
*/json-server.log
*/serve.log
