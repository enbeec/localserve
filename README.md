# localserve
a script for working with serve and json-server

## Installation
Just copy the `ls-scripts` directory along with `localserve` itself into your repo. Everything else is documented within `localserve` at the top.

Also, it's a good idea to add the following to your `.gitignore` so you don't track transient things like logfiles and live database files:

```
api/db.json
*/json-server.log
*/serve.log
```
